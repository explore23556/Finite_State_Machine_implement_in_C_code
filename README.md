# Finite_State_Machine_implement_in_C_code

## Motivation
### In this project, I want to use Finite State Machine(FSM) to implement the operation of vending machine, and also write two versions of the c code to practice my code skill.

## Difference of the two versions
### fsm_condition_statement.c -> that just use switch statement to read current event or trigger each transitions.
### fsm_struct_implement.c -> that use struct array to record all states, events, transition functions, so that we can use it to read current event or trigger each transitions.
